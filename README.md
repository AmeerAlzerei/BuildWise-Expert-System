# BuildWise-Expert-System
---

**BuildWise Expert System** is a robust and intelligent decision-making prototype designed to support post-disaster building assessments. This project leverages **fuzzy logic principles** to tackle the complexities of evaluating building damage, setting reconstruction priorities, and allocating resources effectively, especially in scenarios with limited or conflicting data.

## Key Features
- **Fuzzy Logic Framework**: Utilizes fuzzy membership functions and rules for nuanced decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Forward and Backward Chaining**: Implements inference mechanisms to:
  - Derive conclusions from inputs (**Forward Chaining**).
  - Identify conditions required to achieve specific goals (**Backward Chaining**).
- **Configurable Design**: Loads membership functions, rules, and dependency maps dynamically from JSON files, enabling easy customization and scalability.
- **Real-World Testing Scenarios**: Includes multiple forward and backward chaining test cases to validate the system's performance in:
  - Classifying damage levels.
  - Prioritizing reconstruction efforts.
  - Evaluating risk levels.
- **Default Handling**: Automatically assigns default values when no rules are triggered, ensuring stability and reliable outputs.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Designed to integrate new rules, variables, and real-time data for enhanced functionality.

## Objectives
1. **Systematic Assessments**: Provide a structured approach to evaluating post-disaster or post-conflict building conditions.
2. **Address Key Challenges**: Handle issues such as incomplete data, subjective judgments, and dynamic environmental conditions.
3. **Enable Intelligent Recovery Efforts**: Lay the groundwork for safer and more efficient reconstruction strategies in Gaza and beyond.

## What's Included
This repository contains:
1. **Python Implementation**: The full expert system logic.
2. **Configuration Files**: JSON files defining membership functions, rules, and dependencies.
3. **Test Cases**: Scripts demonstrating forward and backward chaining in real-world scenarios.
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guidance for understanding, running, and extending the system.
